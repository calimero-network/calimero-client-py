//! `SealedClient` (`calimero_client_py._native`): the attested sealed
//! channel to the nodes of a Calimero 1.0 cluster, under the Python client.
//!
//! The routes are a client generated from core's OpenAPI document; the
//! Python package (`calimero_client_py`) runs it on [`request`]
//! (`SealedClient.request`) through an httpx transport, and answers the
//! node's step-ups (`412 CONFIRM_REQUIRED`, `428 OPERATOR_SIGNATURE_REQUIRED`)
//! there. What stays in Rust is what a generated client cannot be made of:
//! the attestation and the sealed channel ([`sealed`]), the recovery that
//! moves between nodes and refreshes a session ([`recover`], [`directory`]),
//! the event streams ([`streams`]), and the keys the client signs with
//! ([`account`], [`account_recovery`], [`org_recovery`], the operator key).
//! Every method blocks with the GIL released.
//!
//! [`request`]: PyCloudClient::request
