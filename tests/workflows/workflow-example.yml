description: A sample workflow that demonstrates the bootstrap functionality with dynamic value capture
name: Sample Calimero Workflow

# Force pull Docker images even if they exist locally
force_pull_image: true

nodes:
  chain_id: testnet-1
  count: 2
  image: ghcr.io/calimero-network/merod:edge
  prefix: calimero-node

steps:
  # Step 1: Install the application on the first node
  # This captures the application ID for use in subsequent steps
  - name: Install Application on Node 1
    type: install_application
    node: calimero-node-1
    url: https://calimero-only-peers-dev.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/kv_store.wasm
    outputs:
      app_id: applicationId          # Export 'applicationId' field as 'app_id'

  # Step 2: Create a context using the installed application
  # Uses the captured application ID from step 1
  - name: Create Context on Node 1
    type: create_context
    node: calimero-node-1
    application_id: '{{app_id}}'
    outputs:
      context_id: contextId          # Export 'contextId' field as 'context_id'
      member_public_key: memberPublicKey  # Export 'memberPublicKey' as 'member_public_key'

  # Step 3: Generate an identity on the second node
  # This captures the public key for use in invitation and joining
  - name: Create Identity on Node 2
    type: create_identity
    node: calimero-node-2
    outputs:
      public_key: publicKey         # Export 'publicKey' as 'public_key'

  # Step 4: Wait for identity creation to complete
  - name: Wait for Identity Creation
    type: wait
    seconds: 5

  # Step 5: Invite the second node to join the context
  # Uses captured values: context ID, member public key, and identity public key
  - name: Invite Node 2 from Node 1
    type: invite_identity
    node: calimero-node-1
    context_id: '{{context_id}}'
    grantee_id: '{{public_key}}'
    granter_id: '{{member_public_key}}'
    capability: member
    outputs:
      invitation: invitation         # Export 'invitation' as 'invitation'

  # Step 6: Join the context from the second node
  # Uses captured values: context ID, invitee identity, and invitation data
  - name: Join Context from Node 2
    type: join_context
    node: calimero-node-2
    context_id: '{{context_id}}'
    invitee_id: '{{public_key}}'
    invitation: '{{invitation}}'
