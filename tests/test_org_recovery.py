"""
Organization recovery through CloudClient (core `docs/specs/org-recovery.md`):
the owner sets a recovery key, an account holding the seed starts a recovery
that waits 72 hours, the owner can cancel it, a wrong seed and a non-owner are
refused, and rotating the key makes the old seed useless. Waiting out the
delay is core's own test (`an_owner_who_lost_every_passkey_recovers_the_org`);
here the recovery stops at `409 RECOVERY_NOT_READY`.

The wire bytes are checked against core's pinned vectors everywhere; the
cluster test has the same requirements as test_cloud_v2.py (a merod binary,
from core 1.0.0-rc.10 or later: the first release with these routes).
