"""The operations of core's node API, one method each: generated, do not edit.

Made by scripts/generate_facade.py from openapi/openapi.json and the
generated calls in `calimero_client_py.openapi`. Reach them on a client:
`client.orgs.invite_create(org=..., role="member")`. Arguments are
keyword-only: the path's, the query's and the JSON body's fields; a
raw-byte body is `body=`. Each returns the generated model of the success
answer and raises `CloudError` on a refusal. A `412 CONFIRM_REQUIRED` is
answered with the client's passkey (`Client.use_passkey`) and a `428
OPERATOR_SIGNATURE_REQUIRED` with its operator key
or signer (`Client.use_operator_key`, `Client.use_operator_signer`); per
call, `confirm=` takes a passkey, a ready `confirm` value or `False`, and
`operator_proof=` an operator seed (hex), a signer, a ready
`operatorProof` value or `False`. `client.json.<group>` answers JSON.
