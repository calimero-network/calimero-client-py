"""`Client` (also `CloudClient`): a client for one Calimero 1.0 cluster.

The routes are `calimero_client_py.openapi`, generated from core's OpenAPI
document; `Client.api()` gives the generated calls a client whose transport
seals every request to the node's attested key (`calimero_client_py.sealed`).
What is not a route is the native `SealedClient`'s: the attestation and the
sealed channel, the move between nodes and the refresh of a session, the event
streams, and the keys the client signs with.

The routes are the facade's methods (`client.orgs.invite_create(...)`, one
per operation, generated): 2.0 removed the method per route earlier releases
had (CHANGELOG.md maps each to its facade method). What stays here is what is
not a route: the passkey ceremonies, the streams, the generic path calls and
the key helpers.

    Connect to `base_url`. The node is trusted only once its attestation
    verifies; `allow_mock` accepts development (mock) quotes, `app_hash`
    (hex) pins the bundle the quote must bind.

    `nodes` are other nodes of the same cluster, in the order to move to
    them when a node answers `421 WRONG_NODE` (its release may not serve
    the account); each is attested under the same policy before anything
    is sent to it. Without them that answer is raised as `WrongNode`.
    A node that cannot be reached, or that keeps answering `503` to a read
    or a call, is left for the next too (each node once per request).
    A `401` to a request made with a session is answered by one refresh
    (any node takes it) and the request sent again; `LoginRequired` is
    raised only when that does not help.

    A real TDX quote is accepted only from an image the policy names:
    `tee_profiles` admits nodes whose signed mero-tee release lists their
    measurements under one of those profiles (`min_release` is a floor).
    Without it, only mock quotes (`allow_mock`) can be accepted. A
    release's debug profiles (whose memory the host can read) are refused
